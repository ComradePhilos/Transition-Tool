# Transition-Tool

A GUI tool that can move files with certain prefixes in their filename to a chosen directory. It does not only move them
but also sorts them by prefix. Also you can activate a date filter. The programme was made to have a simple tool on
Windows, which lacks some useful functions for the command line.
Programme GUI right now is only in German, because the programme is actually made for Germany. If you wish, you should easily be able to translate the few strings on your own (even without knowing German).
